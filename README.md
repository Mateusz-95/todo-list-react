# Todo-list in React
! [print screen from todo-list] (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mateusz-95/todo-list-react/main/public/printscreen.png)

Hark, dear reader, and lend thy ear! <br>
Forsooth, I present to thee a project most dear. <br>
In this endeavor, I have learned to wield <br>
The powers of React, a mighty technology to yield. <br>

A "To-Do List" did I bring, ere this project began <br>
In vanilla JS, it was formed by my hand. <br>
But lo, I transferred it to React's fair domain <br>
A task most daunting, but one that was not in vain. <br>

So, gentle reader, if it please thee <br>
Take a moment to peruse this work of mine, I pray thee. <br>
And if thou findest it worthy of acclaim <br>
Leave thy feedback, thy comments and thy name. <br>

Thus, with a humble heart and a grateful mind <br>
I bid thee farewell, and leave thee to unwind. <br>

PS: That was GPT in Shakespeare style ;)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Demo 
https://mateusz-95.github.io/todo-list-react/

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
